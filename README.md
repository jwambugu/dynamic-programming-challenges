# Dynamic Programming Challenges

This repository contains dynamic coding challenges and their solutions. The programming languages used are `go`
and `javascript`.

The challenges from this course are
from [Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges](https://youtu.be/oBt53YbR9Kk) by
FreeCodeCamp which uses javascript, but I recreated them using `go`.
