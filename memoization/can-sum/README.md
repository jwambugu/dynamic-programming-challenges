# Can Sum

Write a function `canSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a target sum and an array of numbers as arguments. The
function should return a boolean indicating whether it is possible to generate the target sum using numbers from the
array.

You may use an element of the array as many times as needed. You may also assume that all inputs are non-negative.

### Examples

 ```javascript
canSum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7]) // true
// 3 +4
// 7
```

 ```javascript
canSum(7, [2, 4]) // false
```
